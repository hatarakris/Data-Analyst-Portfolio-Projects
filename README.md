# Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Projects

Hello, I'm Kristoforus Nugrahanto. For the past few months, I've been learning data analytics along with the tools that are commonly used, mainly Pandas, SQL, and Tableau.
I am a complete beginner in coding and I have little to no experience in data analytics, but I feel eager to learn more about this field. 
This repository was created as a place to host my data projects and to serve as my portfolio.

My CV in PDF.

MyAnimeList EDA.

This is my first ever project using scraped data from myanimelist.net, and downloaded from kaggle. To get started on my first project,
I thought that I should use a dataset that I am passionate about, or at least interested in, which is anime. This project contains some
data cleaning and wrangling using Pandas, and simple visualizations using Seaborn.
