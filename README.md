# Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Projects

Hello, I'm Kristoforus Nugrahanto. For the past few months, I've been learning data analytics along with the tools that are commonly used, mainly Pandas, SQL, and Tableau.
I am a complete beginner in coding and I have little to no experience in data analytics, but I feel eager to learn more about this field. 
This repository was created as a place to host my data projects and to serve as my portfolio.
