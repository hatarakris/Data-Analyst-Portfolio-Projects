# Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Projects

Hello, I'm Kristoforus Nugrahanto. For the past few months, I've been learning data analytics along with the tools that are commonly used, mainly Pandas, SQL, and Tableau.
This repository was created as a place to host my data analysis projects and to serve as my portfolio.
