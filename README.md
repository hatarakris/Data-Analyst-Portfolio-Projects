# Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Projects

Hello, I'm Kristoforus Nugrahanto. For the past few months, I've been learning data analytics along with the tools that are commonly used, mainly Pandas, SQL, and Tableau.
I am a complete beginner in coding and I have little to no experience in data analytics, but I feel eager to learn more about this field. 
This repository was created as a place to host my data projects and to serve as my portfolio.

My [CV] in PDF.

## Data Projects:
### [Most Recommended Title According to MyAnimeList](https://github.com/hatarakris/Data-Projects/blob/main/anime_EDA.ipynb)
This is my first ever project using scraped data from myanimelist.net that I downloaded from kaggle. To get started on my first project,
I thought that I should use a dataset that I am passionate about, or at least interested in, which is anime. This project contains some
data cleaning and wrangling using Pandas, and simple visualizations using Seaborn.

### [Airlines EDA](https://github.com/hatarakris/Data-Projects/blob/main/airlines.ipynb)
In this project, I explored flight data from popular airlines in India and find out whether there are any differences in ticket prices
according to flight class, departure city, etc. I used Seaborn to make simple visualizations and gain some insights from the data.

### [Covid-19 Data Exploration](https://github.com/hatarakris/Data-Projects/blob/main/covid-data-exploration.sql)

### [British Airways Review](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kristoforus.nugrahanto/viz/BritishAirwaysReview_17299539842700/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
